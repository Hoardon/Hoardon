## 🌍 Real-World Impact

### 🏦 Large-Scale Production Applications

I work on a **major French online banking application**, serving **millions of users**.
Context & challenges:
- High traffic and strict performance requirements
- Strong constraints on security, stability, and compliance
- Frequent releases with zero tolerance for regressions

Key responsibilities:
- Developing and maintaining critical mobile features
- Ensuring performance and UI stability at scale
- Leading Android and Flutter migrations
- Collaborating closely with backend, QA, and product teams
- Improving code quality through architecture, testing, and reviews
- Contributing to technical decisions with long-term impact

This experience reinforced a pragmatic, quality-first approach to mobile development.

### 🚀 Startup & Early-Stage Product Experience

I also have strong experience in **early-stage product development**, where I’ve been deeply involved in:
- Designing mobile products from the ground up  
- Making technical and architectural decisions early on  
- Working closely with product direction, sales, and stakeholders  
- Recruiting and mentoring developers  
- Establishing development standards and best practices  

This combination of **startup agility** and **enterprise-scale rigor** allows me to adapt quickly while keeping long-term quality in mind.
